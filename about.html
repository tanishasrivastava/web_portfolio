        <h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Tanisha Srivastava, a 2nd-year B.Tech-CSE student specializing in Full-Stack Development from The NorthCap University in Gurugram. I am a passionate and aspiring developer who loves coding and solving problems.</p>
        <p>My journey into the tech world began with a simple curiosity about how the websites function, and it quickly turned into a deep dive into the world of programming. Since then, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. I started my journey by first learning the core programming languages such as Java, C++, and C. As I had a thing for the concpet of development , I took Full-Stack Development as my specialisation in 2nd Year of my college. After which I started my journey in it , by learning the frontend langauages and library such as the HTML, CSS JS and React on my own , which I am still perfecting day by day by working and making various projects. While pursuing my specialisation in Full-Stack development I also learned about the concept of Servlets, Cookie Management , JSP and how to actively link a database with the website using these technologies and have also made a project on it. </p>
        <p>With each project that I make or work on and each technology that I study about, it gives me the joy and the ethusiasm to learn and build more.</p>
        <p>Also I have a keen interest in App Development which made me attend various cohorts and workshops under Reskill, Azure Developer Commuinty, Amazon WoW etc which helped me in learning and knowing more about Flutter. When I'm not coding, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies such as reading, journaling and occasionally experimenting with new cooking recipes. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving tech industry which has soo much to offer us.</p>
